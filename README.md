## 🚀 Selected Projects

📊 [COVID-19 Data Modeling](https://github.com/Bon666/covid19-data-modeling.git)  
Used regression models and curve fitting to analyze pandemic data and predict trends. Visualized outcomes using Python (matplotlib, seaborn).

📦 [Linear Programming Solver](https://github.com/Bon666/linear-programming-solver.git)  
Implemented a simplex method solver from scratch in Python to handle small-scale LP problems. Includes interactive input and LaTeX output.

📈 [PCA Visualization of Iris Dataset](https://github.com/Bon666/pca-iris-visualization.git)  
Applied Principal Component Analysis on classic datasets to demonstrate dimensionality reduction and clustering.

🧮 [Stock Price Analysis](https://github.com/Bon666/stock-price-analysis.git)  
This project performs exploratory data analysis and visualization of Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s stock price using data pulled directly from Yahoo Finance.

📈 [Portfolio Optimizer](https://github.com/Bon666/portfolio_optimizer.git)  
This project builds a portfolio optimization model using historical price data of multiple stocks. It calculates the optimal asset allocation to maximize returns relative to risk (Sharpe Ratio) or to minimize portfolio volatility.

📈 [Global Financial Indicators Tracker](https://github.com/Bon666/Financial-Data-Tracker.git)  
A Python-based project that pulls and visualizes real-time financial indicators — including stock indices, equities, and commodity ETFs — using Yahoo Finance as a data source.

📈 [Global Market Intelligence Dashboard](https://github.com/Bon666/market-intelligence-dashboard.git)  
An advanced, multi-asset data analysis project designed to assess global financial markets. This project brings together risk-return analysis, dimensionality reduction, asset clustering, and interactive visualizations — all powered by real-world financial data from Yahoo Finance.
